## Predicting Exercise Performance Using Wearable Devices

# Project Description
This project aims to predict the manner in which participants performed barbell lifts, using data collected from accelerometers placed on various parts of their bodies. The goal is to classify the exercise technique into different categories.

# Background
Using wearable devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit, it has become cost-effective to collect extensive data on personal activity. The quantified self movement, which consists of enthusiasts regularly measuring themselves to improve health, identify behavioral patterns, or simply for the love of technology, is gaining momentum. While people frequently quantify the amount of a particular activity they do, they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, we use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of 6 participants who performed barbell lifts in both correct and incorrect ways. More information about the project can be found on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset website.
